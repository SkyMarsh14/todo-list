# Todo List Project

## Overview
This Todo List project is a modular JavaScript application designed for organizing tasks efficiently. It enables users to create and manage tasks with essential details like title, description, due date, and priority, grouped under different projects. The app also uses Local Storage to persist data across sessions, so users can retrieve their tasks even after a page refresh. Additionally, the date-fns library is used for handling date formatting and manipulation with ease.

## Features
- **Modular Structure**: Separates application logic from the DOM for easier maintenance and scalability.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses the Local Storage API to save tasks and projects on the user's device, retaining data after page reloads.
- **Project-Based Task Organization**: Allows users to create multiple projects and view tasks specific to each project.
- **Task Details and Prioritization**: Displays task titles, due dates, and priority levels, with an option to expand for more details or to edit.
- **Date Management**: Integrated date-fns library for flexible date formatting and manipulation.
